# Quantum Simulation Final Project

Final project for the course on Quantum Simulation.

The project starts from the paper: [Learning ground states of quantum Hamiltonians with graph networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06390).
It tries to replicate the paper's results in simplified and increasingly more complex settings(arranged in a diamond shape):

    1. root: study a probabilistic mixture on a small lattice so that I can use an exhaustive energy evaluation
    2. branch_quantum: study a quantum superposition on a small lattice (exhaustive evaluation)
    3. branch_mcmc: study a probabilistic mixture with mcmc evaluation
    4. merge: study a quantum superposition with mcmc evaluation
