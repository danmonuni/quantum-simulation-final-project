# AI Models for Physics Final Project

Final project for the course on Quantum Simulation.

The project starts from the paper: [Learning ground states of quantum Hamiltonians with graph networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06390).
It tries to replicate the paper's results in simplified and increasingly more complex settings.

how-to-use: 
    other folders contain the modular components of the project shall I develop it further
    in the notebook section there is a complete and functioning notebook

approach: for learning reasons, I will follow an incremental approach with a diamond shape.
    root: study a probabilistic mixture on a small lattice so that i can use an exhaustive energy evaluation
    branch_quantum: study a quantum superposition on a small lattice (exhaustive evaluation)
    branch_mcmc: study a probabilistic mixture with mcmc evalutaion
    merge: study a quantum superposition with mcmc evaluation
